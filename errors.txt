Unsure if this case is an error, but it's very subtle, perhaps a version 2(II) if the product, but separated by a space.

An extra word "Zoom" has been added in the description (which could possibly represent a model variant). Looking online shows that this is in fact the same camera, but searching this was no trivial case, and trying to match it in geenral may case many false positives.

**FIXED** The family and model have been reversed -- we could add this as a possible search string to remove this case, since in general the order might be ambigious.
